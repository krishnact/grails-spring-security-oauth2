Spring Security OAuth2 Plugin
=======

This a temporary fork of [yohannrub](https://github.com/yohannrub/grails-spring-security-oauth2)'s
fork of the Grails Spring Security OAuth2 plugin, containing their Grails 4
compatible changes.  We need it to get OAuth working in our Grails 4 apps; hopefully
the official plugin will be updated for Grails 4 soon.

See the [official plugin README](https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-spring-security-oauth2)
for documentation.
